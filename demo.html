			<h2> A brief history of the internet </h2>
			<p> In the 1960s, computers started communicating with eachother. From this, the internet was born in 1969. The internet at the start was extremely simple, just sending plain text files back and forth through FTP. Then came along HTML, HTTP, and browsers. These all formed what is known as the web nowadays. Browsers were intially very personal. Unfortunatley, through this, they were very hard to be broadly compatiable. Each browser had many different features but were not likely to be used on many sites or other browsers. Out of this tumutous time came Internet Explorer. IE held up a standard for a while, helped by W3C making offical standards. Eventually, IE started to fight alot more to stay ontop, and was eventually dethroned by Chrome, which became the standard browser, due to its speed and standardized approach.</p>

			<h2> A brief aside on the quality of IE vs Chrome </h2>
			<p> Internet explorer, nowadays Edge, is literally the worst browser you could have. It defaults to BING as the standard browser, which im pretty sure a total of 3 actual people use. Chrome is just better. It's faster, cleaner looking, uses google like a sane person, and has extreme support for pretty much everything you can find.</p>
